# [My website on Julius Caesar](https://kevin872.github.io/Julius-Caesar-Web/home.html)
This is my first ever website, and it was ___made from scratch___. I have never made one before, and I have no clue why. Every step of the process was fun,
like learning how to code in HTML and CSS, implementing a creative design, 
and learning new ways to do things in the creation process. This is also my project for English class.

## The English Project Aspect
My wesite is more focused on characters. I chose to focus on characters because I really like how diffrent they all are,
and I also wnated to provide some of my favorite quotes that describe these characters. Personally, when going over the story,
while I did like the plot, story structure, and use of literary terms, the thing that grabbed my attention the most was the characters.
I find the stories of each one interesting, like the lies and deception of Cassius, the mental torment experienced by 
Brutus when deciding wether he should kill his friend, the cleverly thought out argument made by Portia, as well as her extreme death, and more.
Im glad that I could choose what I wanted to discuss in this project, and im also happy that there was a wide variety of options
when choosing what kind of project I could do, and thanks to the variety of options, I was able to choose something that I have been wanting to do, building
a website, but could never come around to sparing the time to do it.

## The Website Aspect
I made my website minimalistic because I really like that style of web design, and also because 
I cannot make a project like this too complex due to my lack of experience in making websites.

### How It Works
I made my website in a way that the information is in a rounded box. The boxes are interactive because they change color when you hover over them. 
But that's not it. Each color change has a different effect. Here is what the colors indicate:

* The boxes that turn black send you to a page on the website that provides you with more information.
* The boxes that turn blue and purple send you back to a black box with more condensed information.

To navigate around the website, you can also use the home bar at the top of every page. The only page that is not on the home bar is the In-Depth Character Analysis page. There are two ways to get to this page.

* The first way is to:

  * Go to the characters link in the home bar
  * Click on one of the text boxes that turn black
  
* The second way is to:
  * In the homepage, find the block of text that lists the main characters of the play and click on it.
  * Now you are on the characters page, and you will want to click on one of the text boxes that turn black.
